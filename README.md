# Tumbrel

`noun`

1. one of the carts used during the French Revolution to convey victims to the guillotine.
2. a farmer's cart, especially one for hauling manure, that can be tilted to discharge its load.
3. Obsolete. a two-wheeled covered cart accompanying artillery for carrying tools, ammunition, etc.

***

Okay ... *that* was a bit morbid but hey, it *is* a shopping cart so the analogy is somewhat apt.
